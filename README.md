#NFT preview card component

![Design preview for the NFT preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)


## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements




## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.


## Got feedback for us?

I love receiving feedback! I am always looking to improve!
